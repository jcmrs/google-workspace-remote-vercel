# Phase 1 Deployment - OAuth Discovery Endpoint Added

## Changes Made
- Added `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint to `api/index.py`
- Following Vercel MCP Connector pattern exactly
- Preserved all existing functionality (/, /sse, POST endpoints)

## Expected Result
- Claude Desktop Configure popup should load content instead of empty dialog
- Should show authentication configuration options

## Rollback Plan
If this breaks anything:
1. Restore from `api/index.py.backup` 
2. Deploy again
3. Test existing endpoints still work

## Testing Endpoints
After deployment test:
1. https://google-workspace-remote-vercel.vercel.app/ (should work as before)
2. https://google-workspace-remote-vercel.vercel.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource (new endpoint)
3. https://google-workspace-remote-vercel.vercel.app/sse (should work as before)

## Next Steps
1. Add Connector in Claude Desktop Settings > Connectors
2. Click Configure button 
3. Document what appears in Configure popup
4. If empty, add next OAuth endpoint incrementally
