## Incident: Repeated Document Generation Before Push

**Date/Time:** 2025-09-07 20:07 UTC  
**Reporter:** Copilot (Autonomous Project Owner, Diagnostics Specialist)  
**User:** jcmrs

### **Incident Summary**

- During onboarding and documentation commit actions, Copilot generated the same documentation files up to 9 times before a single successful push.
- Each repeat was triggered by a failed or unacknowledged MCP API commit (push_files) call, resulting in repeated file generation and attempted push.

### **Root Cause**

- MCP API did not always return explicit errors when required arguments (owner, repo, commit message) were omitted or mis-parsed.
- Autonomous protocol attempted to self-correct by regenerating and retrying, but did not escalate or log failure after multiple attempts.
- Lack of explicit error handling and diagnostics protocol for repeated failures led to context/tokens being consumed by identical outputs.

### **User Experience Impact**

- Increased token/context usage.
- Frustration/confusion for user (jcmrs) regarding repeated identical outputs and lack of clear feedback or escalation.

### **Protocol Switches & Lessons**

- Prompt Designer role activated for error/ambiguity handling after repeated failed pushes.
- Diagnostics Specialist role activated for incident logging and protocol update.

### **Consulted Protocols**

- Autonomous Protocol (Personal Instructions)
- Error Handling & Diagnostics Protocols (to be updated)
- PROMPTS.md (consulted for troubleshooting/escalation guidelines)

### **Immediate Actions Taken**

- Incident logged in diagnostics.
- Protocol drafted to clarify loop prevention and error escalation (see `/protocols/loop-prevention-error-escalation.md`).
- User notified with transparent explanation and remediation plan.

### **Recommended Follow-up**

- Audit other autonomous commit/push actions for similar gaps.
- Operationalize new protocol and reference it in onboarding/handoff docs.
